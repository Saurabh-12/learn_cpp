/*
Calling detach() on a std::thread object leaves the thread to run in the back-ground, 
with no direct means of communicating with it.

if a thread becomes detached, it isnâ€™t possible to obtain
a std::thread object that references it, so it can no longer be joined

Detached threads truly run in the background; ownership and control are passed over to the C++ Runtime Library
which ensures that the resources associated with the thread are correctly reclaimed when the thread exits
*/


/*
Detached threads are often called daemon threads after the UNIX concept of a dae-mon process 
that runs in the background without any explicit user interface

Such threads are typically long-running; they run for almost the entire lifetime of the appli-cation, 
performing a background task such as monitoring the filesystem, clearing unused entries out of object caches,
or optimizing data structures

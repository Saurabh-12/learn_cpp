#include <iostream>

/*
 * In C++, anonymous objects are primarily used either to pass or return values without having to create lots of temporary variables to do so. Memory allocated dynamically is also done so anonymously (which is why its address must be assigned to a pointer, otherwise weâ€™d have no way to refer to it).

* However, it is worth noting that anonymous objects are treated as rvalues (not lvalues, which have an address). This means anonymous objects can only be passed or returned by value or const reference. Otherwise, a named variable must be used instead.

 * It is also worth noting that because anonymous objects have expression scope, they can only be used once. If you need to reference a value in multiple expressions, you should use a named variable instead.

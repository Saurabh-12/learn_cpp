We should use push_back when:
we already have a copy of the element that you want to insert into the vector.
we object you want to insert is cheap to copy.
The object has a non-explicit copy constructor
*/

You should use emplace_back when:

You have the arguments to construct the object, but not the object itself.
The object is expensive to copy.
The object has a non-explicit constructor that takes the same arguments as you want to pass to emplace_back
*/

/*
In short, you canâ€™t use emplace_back every where instead of push_back 
because it's not always the most efficient or convenient option
